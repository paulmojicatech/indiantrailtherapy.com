Abraham, LCSW is a licensed clinical psychotherapist providing individual, couples and family therapy.  She maintains a private practice in Indian Trail, North Carolina, a suburb just 15 miles from the city of Charlotte. ","With over ten years of experience as a cognitive behavioral therapist, and as a graduate of Columbia University in the City of New York, she is currently serving as a private practitioner working with a broad spectrum of clients.  Among her areas of expertise are depression, anxiety, PTSD, self-esteem issues, adjusting to life changing events, trauma and loss, relationship and intimacy issues, work and career counseling, anger and stress management, and self- harming behaviors, in the adolescent and adult population.","Kirstin R. Abraham is an interactive, cognitive behavioral therapist. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy focuses on how you think about the things going on in your life \u2013 your thoughts, images, beliefs and attitudes (your cognitive processes) \u2013 and how this impacts the way you behave and deal with emotional problems.  It then looks at how you can change any negative patterns of thinking or behavior that may be causing you difficulties.  And this in turn, can change the way you feel.  In CBT, you will learn to recognize how you think, behave and feel.  You will then be encouraged to try other ways of thinking and behaving that may be more useful and ultimately lead to personal growth, insight and a happier and healthier lifestyle.","Kirstin R. Abraham seeks to provide support and practical feedback to help clients effectively address personal life challenges.  She integrates complementary methodologies and techniques to offer a highly personalized approach tailored to each client.  With compassion and understanding, she works with each individual to help them build on their strengths and attain the personal growth they are committed to accomplishing."],Education:[{School:"Columbia University School of Social Work, New York, N.Y.",Description:"Masters of Science in Social Work, May 2008",Awards:["Summa Cum Laude"]},{School:"Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, P.A.",Description:"Bachelors of Arts, Psychology, May 2006",Awards:["Magna Cum Laude with Departmental Honors","Deans Honor List","Alpha Lamda Delta - National Honor Society","Psi Chi - Psychology Honor Society"]},{School:"Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom",Description:"London and Lancaster England, Fall of 2005",Awards:[]}],LicenseCertsAwards:["Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), in the State of North Carolina","Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), in the State of Florida","Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), in New York State","Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW), in New York State","FARS / CFARS certified","Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths with Mental Health Challenges (CANS-MH), certified","University of South Florida course The Baker Act - certificate","5 hour Cultural Competency / Communication - certificate","Bridges to Health (B2H) Home & Community Based Services Medicaid Waiver WSP Training Program in Crisis Services - certificate","Hoarding Disorder: Effective Approaches to Assessment, Diagnosis & Treatment certified 1/30/15","Clinical Supervision Certificate Training.
